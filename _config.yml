#the site will probably be organised by way of jekyll collections, which correspond to folders in the git repository, give or take some
#collections:
#  tutorials:
#    order:
#      - hello-world.md
#      - introduction.md
#      - concepts/basics.md
#      - concepts/advanced.md
#OR
#collections:
#  tutorials:
#    sort_by: lesson
#WHERE "lesson" is a front matter metadata in the page

#just-the-docs supports multiple layouts. modify _layouts/home.html to be a parent layout (like the default layout) to render the markup from the other theme.
