# Getting your affairs in order

## Wills and POAs

Law offices often offer free wills. They make their money off of upselling POAs and the executor fee for the will if you die. You don’t need a will until you have like 10k at least, unless you have kids, then the will should talk about who you want to get your kids when you die. The contents of the will should not be a surprise to anybody, that’s how you get estate disputes. You do need to make some provision for all your kids and other dependents, or they can take your estate to court and get a share anyway.

Wills are mostly boilerplate, and you don’t need a fancy lawyer to do essentially a boilerplate service. Much more important is that they’re responsive and actually listen to you. If you know a lawyer, they might not be the right lawyer but they will almost certainly know the right lawyer.

Keep a copy of your will. Have your executor keep a copy of your will, if possible. The law office who did the will should keep a copy on file, but it pays to confirm this.

POA is also a boilerplate service. It isn’t likely to be an issue until after you have the spare 1k to get it made. Same applies to the lawyers.

You do want a very good lawyer who is also responsive and listens to you if you’re getting fancy with your estate planning. That means find a specialist in trusts and estate planning if you’re going to do that.

## Advance care planning

Which is like POA but more detailed, and you can get it into the medical system without them calling your POA, which is something.

## Bus planning

Do your bus and estate planning early. You can get hit by a bus at any time. Also, many places have laws about gifting and estate tax and stuff, so if you’re doing anything even remotely resembling avoidance, you should set up early enough to avoid that. (If you sell your holiday home on the lake, gift half the proceeds to each kid as down payments, and then go into a rest home &lt;5 years later, the government will come after your kids to pay for the rest home.)

Bitwarden has this cool feature where you can designate a backup person.

## Other documentation

Info.xls and also a physical file location and also a dropbox or whatever. Keep common ones on file, update as necessary, you’ll thank me when you know exactly where to look up whatever it is. See also bitwarden.
